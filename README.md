Educational Investment Data Analysis

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that presents a data analysis for educational investment across various countries and sub-regions. The analysis is based on educational statistics and indicators related to internet usage, government expenditure on education, GDP per capita, population demographics, and more. The primary goal of this project is to identify countries and sub-regions that exhibit promising potential for educational investment.

Dataset
The analysis is conducted using two datasets:

EdStatsData.csv: This dataset contains educational statistics from various countries, including indicators related to primary, secondary, and tertiary education, internet usage, GDP per capita, and demographic information.

unstatscountries.csv: This dataset provides information about countries, including their ISO-alpha3 codes and sub-regions.

Both datasets are used in conjunction to perform the analysis.

Prerequisites
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the data analysis, you need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone or download the ZIP file.

Make sure you have the required datasets, EdStatsData.csv and unstatscountries.csv, in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

Open the Jupyter Notebook, educational_investment_analysis.ipynb, using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the notebook cells in sequence to perform the data analysis step by step.

The results of the analysis will be displayed through various visualizations and tables, showcasing investment scores for countries and sub-regions.
